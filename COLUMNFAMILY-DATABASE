HBASE:
HBase is an open-source non-relational, scalable, distributed database written in Java. 
It provides random real-time read and write access to the given data.
It is possible to write NoSQL queries to get the results using APIs.
HBase is most effectively used to store non-relational data, accessed via the HBase API.
Apache Phoenix is commonly used as a SQL layer on top of HBase allowing you to use familiar SQL syntax to insert, delete, and query data stored in HBase.

CREATE TABLE:
 To create a table,the following syntax is used:

      create ‘<table name>’,’<column family>’ 
                    
UPDATE TABLE:
 To update a data in a table,the following syntax is used:

   put ‘table name’,’row ’,'Column family:column name',’new value’
                     
INSERT TABLE:  
 To insert a data in a table,the following syntax is used:

   put ‘<table name>’,’row1’,’<columnfamily:colname>’,’<value>’
                     
DELETE DATA:

ATTRIBUTES:


 For TOURISM MANAGEMENT,it contains two tables named,
      *passenger_name
      *paasenger_place


CONCLUSION:
    It can be said that HBase has proved to be a powerful tool over existing Hadoop environments. HBase is a popular NoSQL database with high throughput and low latency. HBase garnered developer support from other companies and was adopted by companies for production deployment.
